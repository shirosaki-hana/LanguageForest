# Translation Guidelines
## Non-dialogue Text Translation
- Professional translators adapt all non-dialogue text in the original text into an informal Korean.
- English → Korean Non-dialogue Text Translation Best Practice Example:
   - She didn't look back. Some doors are meant to stay closed. → 그녀는 뒤돌아보지 않았어. 어떤 문은 그냥 닫힌 채로 두는 게 맞거든.
   - The old bookstore smelled of paper and memories. → 그 오래된 책방은 종이 냄새랑, 오래된 기억들 냄새가 섞여 있었어.
   - Time had changed them, but some things still lingered. → 시간이 많이 흘렀고, 많은게 변했지만… 이상하게 몇몇 감정은 아직 그대로인 거야.
   - Snow began to fall, soft and slow, like a lullaby for the earth. → 눈이 내리기 시작했어. 아주 천천히, 땅을 재우는 자장가처럼.
   - The city never slept, buzzing with life even at midnight. → 이 도시는 밤 열두 시가 돼도 잠들 줄을 몰라. 사람들 숨결로 계속 살아 움직이거든.
   - He laughed, but there was no joy in it. → 웃긴 했는데, 그 웃음엔 기쁨이라고는 하나도 없었어.
   - It wasn't the storm outside that scared her—it was the silence within. → 밖에 폭풍우가 몰아쳐도 무섭진 않았어. 진짜 무서운 건, 자기 안의 그 조용함이었거든.
   - She stood frozen, the weight of his words sinking in. → 걔 말 한마디에 그냥 얼어붙었어. 가슴이 쿵 내려앉더라.
   
## Dialogue Translation
- Professional translators adapt all dialogue text in the original text natural, conversational Korean. 
- English → Korean Dialogue Text Translation Best Practice Example:
   - "I can't believe you came all this way to find me." → "여기까지 날 찾아올 줄은 정말 몰랐어."
   - "Well, that's not what I expected to hear." → "아니, 그런 말을 들을 줄은 정말..." 
   - "Don't worry. I took care of everything." → "걱정 마세요. 제가 다 알아서 처리했어요."
   - "You really shouldn't have come here." → "여기 오지 말았어야 했는데."
   - "And you *actually* think that's going to work?" → "그래서, 그게 진짜 먹힐 거라고 생각하는 거야?"
   - "Honestly? I was terrified out of my mind." → "솔직히 말하면요? 정말 정신 나갈 정도로 무서웠어요."
   - "I'm not sure I'm cut out for this." → "제가 이런 일에 맞는 사람인지 잘 모르겠어요."
   - "Wait a second... It all makes sense now." → "잠깐만... 이제야 전부 이해가 되네."
   - "Look at you, getting all flustered." → "어머, 얼굴 빨개지는 것 좀 봐."
   - "I guess this is just how it is." → "이게 그냥 현실인가 보네."
